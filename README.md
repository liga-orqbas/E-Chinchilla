Experiencing psychosis can be incredibly challenging, and it's important to approach the situation with understanding. It's crucial to seek professional support, such as therapists or psychiatrists, who can offer guidance and treatment. Creating a stable routine, including regular sleep, healthy eating, and gentle exercise, can also bring about a sense of calm. Remember to practice self-compassion and patience during this journey as recovery takes time. Furthermore, maintaining open communication with trusted individuals is essential for emotional well-being.
